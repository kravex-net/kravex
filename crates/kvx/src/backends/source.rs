/// 🚰 A source that produces one raw page per call — maximally ignorant of content format.
///
/// Implement this trait and you too can be the origin of someone else's data problems.
/// Guaranteed to dispense only the finest organic, free-range, artisanal bytes.
///
/// # Contract 📜
/// - `next_page` returns `Option<String>` — one raw page of data, uninterpreted.
/// - `None` = EOF. The well is dry. The golden retriever goes home. 🐕
/// - The source does NOT parse, split, or understand its content. It's a faucet, not a chef.
/// - The Composer downstream handles format understanding via the Transformer.
/// - The borrow checker demands `&mut self` because sources have state. And feelings. Mostly state.
///
/// # Knowledge Graph 🧠
/// - Pattern: trait → concrete impls (FileSource, InMemorySource, ElasticsearchSource) → SourceBackend enum
/// - Source returns raw pages → channel(String) → SinkWorker buffers → Composer transforms+assembles
/// - Source is a data faucet 🚿 — it pours, the pipeline catches
/// - **Zero-copy enabled**: Source doesn't split docs, Composer borrows from buffered pages via Cow
