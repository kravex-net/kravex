//! 🪣📡🏗️ S3 Rally Source — streaming benchmark data from the cloud, one page at a time.
//!
//! COLD OPEN — EXT. DATA CENTER — 3:47 AM
//!
//! The on-call engineer stared at the terminal. "We need the geonames dataset,"
//! they whispered. "All 11 million documents. From S3. Into a file. By morning."
//! The cursor blinked. The S3RallySource blinked back. "I got you, fam," it said,
//! and began streaming at wire speed.
//!
//! This module implements `Source` for AWS S3, specifically tailored for
//! OpenSearch Benchmark (Rally) track data. Given a track name and an S3 bucket,
//! it streams the object line-by-line using `BufReader` over the SDK's async reader.
//!
//! 🧠 Knowledge graph:
//! - `S3RallySourceConfig`: track name, bucket, region, optional key override
//! - `RallyTrack`: enum of all known benchmark tracks (validated at deserialization)
//! - `S3RallySource`: wraps `BufReader<Box<dyn AsyncRead + Send + Unpin>>` — same read pattern as FileSource
//! - Transport: `GetObject` → `ByteStream::into_async_read()` → `BufReader` → `read_line()`
//! - The `into_async_read()` gives us `tokio::io::AsyncRead`, so we get the exact same
//!   BufReader line-reading loop as FileSource. Same contract. Different origin. Same vibes.
